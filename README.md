# QCEIMS x MNDO Excited-state molecular dynamics

The **[MNDO](https://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/institute/history/1993-to-present/theoretical-chemistry)** program is used to conduct excited-state molecular dynamics.

The **GAMESS** program is used to calculate the molecular orbital energy.

The **Binary-Encounter-Bethe (BEB) model** is used to calculate the ionization cross-section.
