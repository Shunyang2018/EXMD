# QCEIMS x MNDO Excited-state molecular dynamics

The **[MNDO](https://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/institute/history/1993-to-present/theoretical-chemistry)** program is used to conduct excited-state molecular dynamics.

The **[GAMESS](https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/)** program is used to calculate the molecular orbital energy.

The **[Binary-Encounter-Bethe (BEB) model](https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Ionization/intro.html)** is used to calculate the ionization cross-section.

*Where T is the energy of the impact electrons; B is the electron binding energy of MO<sub>i</sub> , U is the kinetic energy of MO<sub>i</sub> ; the occupation number N of MO<sub>i</sub> is two for ground state molecules.*

A modified **[QCEIMS](QCEIM_module/qceims_mndo)** excutable program is used to conduct EXMD simulation.
## Workflow of QCEIMS EXMD
1) The EI spectra are simulated under both ground state and excited state molecular dynamics.
2) The ionization cross section of different electronic state is calculated by BEB model.
3) The hybrid spectrum is generated by mix of different spectra, D<sub>0</sub> and D<sub>1</sub> for example, according to the ionization cross section.

## Pipline using SLURM Workload Manager
### [array.bash](slurm_script/array.bash)
Bash script to generate ground/excited state spectra, respectively.<br />
arry_mix.slurm, folder.slurm and plot_mix.slurm files are needed.

#### File: array_mix.slurm
Slurm script to conduct ground/excited state MD and generate spectra of each.<br /> 
The mndo.opt and qceims.in is needed to run this batch command.<br />

To use:

sbatch<br />
  > --job-name=**name**<br />
  > --array=a-b **job list**<br />
  > --parsable array_mndo.slurm **this slurm file** <br />
  >    **work path**<br />
  >    **user name**<br />
  
Exapmle:
  ```bash
  sbatch   --job-name=array --array=1-400 --parsable array_molcas.slurm /home/ user1
  ```
#### File: qceims.in
The input file for qceims program<br />
  unity:  enforces uniform velocity scaling during the vibrational
          heating phase, which is automatically done if
          the system is larger than 35 atoms.<br />
  MNDOEX: keyword for activating excited-state calculation.<br />
#### File: mndo.opt
The input file for mndo99 program<br />

### [Python script for Ionization cross section](python_script/)
#### File: batch_gms.py
Generate input file for GAMESS program from tmol format coordinate files.
#### File: BEB.py
Read the log file of GAMESS program to calculate ionization cross section and ratio of spectra under D<sub>0</sub> and D<sub>1</sub> state.
#### File: ms_correction_batch.py
Generate hybrid spectra from D<sub>0</sub> and D<sub>1</sub> state spectra and ratio from cross section.
