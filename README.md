# QCEIMS x MNDO Excited-state molecular dynamics

The **[MNDO](https://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/institute/history/1993-to-present/theoretical-chemistry)** program is used to conduct excited-state molecular dynamics.

The **[GAMESS](https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/)** program is used to calculate the molecular orbital energy.

The **[Binary-Encounter-Bethe (BEB) model](https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Ionization/intro.html)** is used to calculate the ionization cross-section.

# Workflow of QCEIMS EXMD
a) ground state spectrum is corrected by D1 state with a ratio of 38% (Urocanic acid)

b) the electronic structure is excited to some higher states an back to D0 or D1 state by internal conversion
