QCEIMS x MNDO Excited-state calculation

Author: Shunyang wang
Date: Aug 4th
How to use MNDO to conduct excited-state MD in QCEIMS,
 need to be mixed with ground state result.
**********************

##array_mndo.slurm##
After the ground state sampling of trajectory inputs, using this file to
modify inputs with excited-state parameters.
The mndo.opt and qceims.in is needed to run this batch command.

To use:
sbatch
  --job-name=array <name>
  --array=3-400 <job list>
  --parsable array_mndo.slurm <slurm file >
  /share/fiehnlab/users/shunyang/xstate_project/qceims/molcas/ <work path>

  "sbatch   --job-name=array --array=3-400 --parsable

**********************
##qceims.in##
The input file for qceims program
  unity:  enforces uniform velocity scaling during the vibrational
          heating phase, which is automatically done if
          the system is larger than 35 atoms.
  MNDOEX: keyword for activating excited-state calculation

##mndo.opt##
The input file for mndo99 program

1. Fixed parts:

nsav15=3 idiis=10 jop=-2 ipubo=1 nprint=-1 iscf=5 kitscf=200 iplscf=5 iop=-6 +
ifast=2 igeom=1 ktrial=11 kharge=1 iform=1 imult=2 ifermi=21000

OM2 method on radical cations with fermi smearing

2. user define parts:

iroot=2 icross=1 ioutci=1 kci=5 ncigrd=1 +

  iroot: Total number of lowest CI states computed.
  icross: Choice of multi-surface treatment.
    icross=1 Calculate energies and gradients for the states
        specified by ncigrd.
  ioutci:Printing flag.
  kci: Choice of correlation treatment.
    kci=5 General configuration interaction based on the
        graphical unitary group approach (GUGA-CI).
  ncigrd: Number of CI gradients to be computed.

movo=-4 ici1=1 ici2=1 nciref=1 +

  movo: Explicit definition of active orbitals.
    =-4 Include MOs with highest d-population in active space.
      For details see description in GUGA section 3.9.
  ici1: Number of active occupied orbitals.
  ici2: Number of active unoccupied orbitals.
  nciref: Number of reference occupations.
    =1: SCF configuration, provided that the spin
    multiplicity is the same for the SCF and CI calculations.
mciref=0 levexc=2 +
  Definition of reference occupations.
        = 0 Chosen by default, no further input.

  levexc: Maximum excitation level relative to any of the reference
          configurations.
          = 1 CIS, only single excitations.
          = 2 CISD, up to double excitations.

an input example for mndo99 generated by qceims is listed as inp.
